# React Combined Context

This repository serves as an example of dynamic nesting in React context management, showcasing how to effectively utilize combined contexts.

## Overview

Handling React contexts in larger applications often involves a critical decision: manual nesting or dynamic nesting. This repository focuses on dynamic nesting, illustrating its benefits and drawbacks with a primary emphasis on enhancing the developer experience.

## Features

- **Explicit Visibility:** Gain a clear understanding of context relationships with explicit visibility in the component tree.
  
- **Simplicity for Newcomers:** Easy for developers to grasp without advanced setup, making it accessible for newcomers.

- **Enhanced Scalability and Maintainability:** Enjoy flexibility for easier modifications, improved readability, and less boilerplate. This simplifies the component tree and enhances code readability.

- **Type Safety with TypeScript:** Ensure reliability and confidence in the codebase with TypeScript support.

- **Considerations:** Understand the trade-offs, including potential verbosity and code complexity in manual nesting and the initial complexity involved in dynamic nesting setup.
